I didn't want to use a template to make my website, so I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I could make it on my own!

[This](http://pgaddison.com) personal website is a little hub for my work-related information like my resume and LinkedIn, as well as a sort of portfolio for various projects and blog posts.

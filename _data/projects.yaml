    We created an Amazon Alexa skill which enables patients to easily report systems without needing to keep a journal or call the doctor. By making it extremely easy to report such symptoms, we could collect a plethora of data that could be used to help predict and diagnose symptoms in the future.

    Using Docker and some Python glue, we engineered an easy-to-use tool for generating network traffic data in a variety of emulated network conditions.

    We teamed with Viasat to use ML to classify network behavior even while VPNs are in use. But, collecting good, representative training data is a hassle. Enter DANE: the *Data Automation and Network Emulation* tool.

- title: QWERTY vs Dvorak

    Why are we stuck typing on the same keyboard layout that was invented for the earliest typewriters?

    The Dvorak keyboard layout is fabled to be much more efficient... come play with this interactive data visualization and put that claim to the test!

    I (ab)used OpenAI's GPT-2 model—the one that's "too dangerous to release"—to make an art piece in which the AI attempts to double the word count of an essay. The model can easily become *too* creative, though!

                            My team is building a hybrid Helpdesk and DevOps chatbot to aid researchers on the Nautilus
                            HyperCluster. We are currently exploring various clustering techniques for natural language
                            queries.

                            This massive Kubernetes cluster which supports the Pacific Research Platform allows
                            researchers to share data and compute resources. They don't all know how to use Kubernetes
                            or Docker, and it's important to maintain cluster health if something accidentally breaks—so
                            that's where Kubot comes in to the picture.

                        <p>
                            Another of our main NSF grants is to create an augmented reality network operations center
                            (AR-NOC) to monitor cluster health and diagnose problems that may arise. I am helping
                            prototype data input pipelines and automate existing diagnosis pipelines.

                        <p>
                            Working closely with one of my favorite professors, Prof. Aaron Fraenkel, we explored bias
                            in various network graph sampling schemes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We developed statistical approaches to describe the bias in a degree distribution from a
                            sampling scheme. We researched new sampling schemes to address this bias, and we implemented
                            the Snowboot R package in Python.

                        <p>
                            As a team of four undergraduates, we were rewarded with a competitive fellowship to conduct
                            a self-lead data science research project. In effort to reduce the negative health effects
                            of food deserts, we developed an accessible tool which generates grocery lists optimized on
                            both nutrition and cost.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We got our hands dirty with various forms of data mining, and turned to pure numerical
                            optimization as our core algorithm. We looked at Linear Programming, Continuous Quadratic
                            Programming, and Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming in order to accomplish our goals.

                            I worked as a machine learning engineer at a startup founded on campus. We built a product

                            Microinfluencers are often location and demographic specific, they fill a particular niche,
                            and they often don't realize that they are an influencer! From a database of all Instagram,
                            YouTube, and Twitter personalities, our service would rank their influence over a given
                            industry and keywords using recommender systems, association rule learning, and other graph
                            theory techniques.

                            We created an Amazon Alexa skill named "Ouch, That Hurts!" which allows patients to easily

                            easy to report such symptoms, we could collect a plethora of data that could be used to help

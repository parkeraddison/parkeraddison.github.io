          <p>
            Last week I got a taste of how cool it is to be a Hollywood-hacker, and how challenging yet rewarding it is to do what I
            assume is closer to actual web-hacking.</p>
          <hr class="short">
          <p>
            First, I learned how to use Selenium with Python and instantly felt like I was rewatching every single movie scene there
            is that involves "hacking". In short,
            <i>I controlled a browser using nothing but the command line!</i> This meant that as I typed code and pressed return
            on one half of my screen, a window popped up and interacted with the web on the other half of my screen, and
            I didn't so much as move my cursor.</p>
          <p>
            Selenium is a web browser automation tool; you can write a set of instructions and then those actions will be carried out
            in a web browser. However, as is always the case with programming, those instructions need to be
            <i>very</i> specific. The easiest thing to do after launching the webdriver (literally the driver that runs the
            browser) is to navigate to a webpage using one command and a full URL address (including the "https://www").
            But after that, you need to know the source code of the page in order to do much else. Unfortunately, unless
            you can magically sense the css-id of an element or rely upon common naming conventions, this means each time
            you want to click on a button or enter text into a field you need to first look at the HTML behind the webpage
            and examine that element. Oh well.</p>
          <p>
            I learned Selenium to help with scraping data off a page that was the result of form inputs and some dynamically loaded content.
            I couldn't access the content through pure HTML requests, so I had to submit the form and let the resulting page
            load in order to get to the data I needed. Sure, I had to carefully examine the webpage every step of the way
            in order to tell the script what to do â€” down to the characters in the element id's â€” but I still got a little
            kick out of every time my browser magically opened and filled out an entire form.</p>
          <p>
            Needless to say, I thought it would be great to feel like a hacker every time I searched something on Google, so I got really
            fast at typing the full google URL, I memorized that the id of the search bar is
            <code>#lst-ib</code>, and I figured out that Python's lovely special characters such as
            <code>\n</code> and
            <code>\b</code> do in fact work to submit my search or to backspace if I spelled something wrong. After that, all I
            needed to do was change my terminal theme to that green/black Matrix aesthetic, and I was set to be cast in the
            next Russian espionage movie.</p>
          <hr class="short">
          <p>
            The second feat is much more inline with what I assume a real web-hacker might do â€” I opened up Firefox's web debugger and
            sifted through the source code of a page in order to access a database that was otherwise hidden. Funnily enough,
            I actually did this in order to avoid the need for Selenium! Loading a page, then scraping the content, then
            reformatting the scraped data into a usable structure seemed a bit inefficient. However, I figured that if the
            page was generating content, then it must have a supply of data, and perhaps I could access that data directly.
            After an initial look at the network requests and then a quick look at the source code of the page, I found just
            what I was looking for. Following a very helpful comment,
            <code>&lt;!-- start of dynamic data load case --&gt;</code>, I found an extended URL that displayed all the data I
            needed in a json format!</p>
          <p>
            I ended up getting lucky here. This was the first site I had to scrape, and coincidentally is the one site behind which I
            absolutely
            <i>love</i> the code â€” there are comments, there's whitespace, there are a bunch of meaningful variable names, it's
            beautiful. This was not the case for the other sites I visited, some of which I'm
            <i>still</i> trying to find a similar backdoor somewhere in the code. There was even one site whose core HTML file
            consisted of a filled out
            <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, an open
            <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, and a rather large handful of
            <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> calls which in turn assembled the
            <i>entire page</i>.</p>
          <p>
            Even though this version of "hacking" is nowhere near as glamorous as green ASCII running down the screen with windows popping
            up and disappearing, finding that backdoor to the database still felt like a total
            <i>"I'm in"</i> moment. Ultimately, this rather simple achievement was much more rewarding than the first â€” and
            likewise much more practical, as web security is an increasingly important topic. As I pursue research projects
            and other forays into data science, I've realized that the simple act of collecting and organizing the data is
            extremely important (and often challenging) in its own right. I hypothesize that my browser's "developer tools"
            will become some of my favorite tools for gathering information off the web.</p>
          <hr class="short double">
          <p>
            * Just as a little disclaimer: my data scraping is entirely for academic research purposes and not for anything commercial.
            I found it a bit ironic that I ended on a note about web security when my ultimate goal is to circumvent it!</p>

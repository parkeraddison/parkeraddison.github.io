Idea:
- Make the main part have a margin on every direct descendence instead of on the wrapper itself
- This allows for full-width content, and for better relative positioning that is robust against changes to page width.





? The nav should disappear when you start to scroll down when at a Post.

- It should reappear when you scroll up or when you're about to reach the bottom of the page.

Began a [USRA NAMS](https://nams.usra.edu) project at NASA Ames. I'm researching ideal distributed data storage solutions and benchmarks for efficient ML/data workflows in their NAS division.

It's a small world after all, so *we're actually taking inspiration from the PRP* (home to the Nautilus cluster and AR-NOC wouldn't ya know it ðŸ˜‰)

With universities transitioning all courses online, teaching strategies likely won&amp;rsquo;t return to &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; once we recover from the pandemic. But might they actually get better?
I&amp;rsquo;m preparing to TA for a now-online course next quarter, and I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed the following topics with a handful of my professors:
On teaching approaches: Flipped classroom to teaching seem promising, but they lack widespread experimentation and support.</description></item><item><title>How an Amazon Alexa skill can open the door to data-driven medical insights</title><link>https://parkeraddison.com/blog/alexa-medical-insight/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 20:47:36 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://parkeraddison.com/blog/alexa-medical-insight/</guid><description>There are a huge number of &amp;ldquo;minor symptoms&amp;rdquo; in the world that go largely unreported. Sore throats, sniffles, dull pains, chest pressures, headaches&amp;hellip; the list goes on. These symptoms are generally not going to prompt a patient to call up their doctor&amp;rsquo;s office. Nor is the patient likely to remember them at all once their next appointment finally comes around.
Doctors wish they could change this. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore how we can change this, and examine the effects of widespread symptom reporting from a data science perspective.</description></item><item><title>Data Science Portfolio ðŸ¤–</title><link>https://parkeraddison.com/portfolio/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2020 13:12:45 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://parkeraddison.com/portfolio/</guid><description>Projects Research Communication (Extra)curriculars Projects .portfolio-project-grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr)); grid-auto-rows: 200px; column-gap: 2em; row-gap: 3em; } .portfolio-project-grid article { break-inside: avoid; background: #fff0; border: 1px solid #0000; border-radius: 1em; } .portfolio-project-grid article:first-of-type { margin-top: unset; } .portfolio-project-content { height: 100%; } .portfolio-project-content h2 { margin-top: 0 !important; } .project-hero { position: relative; height: 100%; } .project-hero .project-hero-image { width: 100%; height: 100%; position: relative; background-size: auto 100%; background-attachment: fixed; --position-offset: 40%; background-position-x: left var(--position-offset); border-radius: 1em; } .</description></item><item><title>This website.</title><link>https://parkeraddison.com/projects/this-website/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkeraddison.com/projects/this-website/</guid><description>I programmed this website using Hugoâ€”an open-source static site builderâ€”and created my own custom themes and scripts.

This was scheduled as the first talk in a series of Ignite Talks with a theme of discovering and pursuing career paths. Ignite Talks are like super-fast TED talksâ€”a speedy style of presentation in which slides advance automatically every 15 seconds, resulting in a 5-minute total run time.</description></item><item><title>Sharing the Road</title><link>https://parkeraddison.com/projects/sharing-the-road/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parkeraddison.com/projects/sharing-the-road/</guid><description>Bikes and cars don&amp;rsquo;t mix well.

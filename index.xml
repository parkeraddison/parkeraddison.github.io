      <description>There are a huge number of ‚Äúminor symptoms‚Äù in the world that go largely unreported. Sore throats, sniffles, dull pains, chest pressures, headaches‚Ä¶ the list goes on.

Doctors wish they could change this. We‚Äôll explore how we can change this, and examine the effects of widespread symptom reporting from a data science perspective.</description>

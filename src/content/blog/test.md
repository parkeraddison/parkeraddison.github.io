## This page should have all elements on it

Like, here will be some text with *italic*, some **bold** stuff, and even some `inline-code` and $\sum_{i=1}^n f'_X(x) * \mathrm{math}$!

As well as [links](null).

### More headings

How about a table? hmm

| A   | B   | C   | D   | Eeeek this is a long heading | F   | G   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | :--------------------------: | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| and this is some long text | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |


- Some lists
- That
    - can go in

1. Or
1. Even be
    1. Ordered

```python
from sklearn.module import other as wow
async def get_frame(self, session):
    """
    This does something
    """
    _, frame = self.real_cam.read()
    # fetch the mask with retries (the app needs to warmup and we're lazy)
    # e v e n t u a l l y c o n s i s t e n t
    mask = None
    while mask is None:
        try:
            mask = await self._get_mask(frame, session)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Mask request failed, retrying: {e}")
            traceback.print_exc()
```

{{< margin >}}
Here's a margin note -- *wow*!
Note that it shows up next to the content that it is written **after**

Here's another [paragraph](null) to look at.
{{< /margin >}}

```javascript
let ofDifferent = flavors ? true : Array;
```

So, what is \
going on?

## This page should have all elements on it

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing an51 typesetting indust71y. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum

Like, here will be some text with *italic*, some **bold** stuff, and even some `inline-code` and $\sum_{i=1}^n f'_X(x) * \mathrm{math}$!

As well as [links](null), bold [**links**](null). Maybe, and [`code links`](null) and [**`bold code links`**](null) wow!.

### More headings

How about a table? hmm

| A   | B   | C   | D   | Eeeek this is a long heading | F   | G   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | :--------------------------: | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| and this is some long text | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |

| This | Needs | To | Be | Really | Long | Super | Cali | Fragil | Istic | Expee | Ali | Doshus | Whew! | That | Wasn't | Even | Quite |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Here's a paragraph that is immediately followed by a list, see?

- Some lists
- That
    - can go in

1. Or
1. Even be
    1. Ordered

```python
from sklearn.module import other as wow
async def get_frame(self, session):
    """
    This does something
    """
    _, frame = self.real_cam.read()
    ################################################################################
    # fetch the mask with retries (the app needs to warmup and we're lazy)
    # e v e n t u a l l y c o n s i s t e n t
    mask = None
    while mask is None:
        try:
            mask = await self._get_mask(frame, session)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Mask request failed, retrying: {e}")
            traceback.print_exc()
```

{{< margin >}}
Here's a margin note -- *wow*!
Note that it shows up next to the content that it is written **after**

Here's another [paragraph](null) to look at.
{{< /margin >}}

```javascript
let ofDifferent = flavors ? true : Array;
```

So, what is \
going on?

Okay here's asoiu piou t vj somfilelr  tasect aasmaple!? WOW.

But pretty soon there'll be

a section break!

<math>
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}

</math>

Display math should be wrapped in some tag like `<div>` or (more semantically) `<math>` to prevent Goldmark from parsing it all wonky.

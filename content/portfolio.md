### Convincing GPT-2 that more is more - An A.I. Art Piece

I (ab)used OpenAI's GPT-2 model—the one that's "too dangerous to release"—to make an art piece which doubles the word count of my high school essay by injecting machine-generated fluff text.

### It might not feature the most data, but I think it's cool

Most pages on my website (including this one) are dynamically populated from Markdown files!

## Sharing the Road
### A data-driven journey on the bike path to enlightenment

I'm writing a blog post detailing some of the interesting results from [a project a teammate and I did in our Geospatial Data Science course](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ParkerGreyAddison/Geospatial-Data-Science/blob/master/mp3.ipynb).

Come back again soon when the post is complete!

## [Neural Network Visual](https://devpost.com/software/neural-network-visual-3d-graphical-editor)
### SD Hacks 2018 @ UC San Diego

Education in Machine Learning has experienced incredible growth. To aid the educational cause, we created an interactive, 3D visual editor for simple neural network models.

## [Ouch! That Hurts](/uc-health-hack.html)
### UC Health Hack 2018 @ UC San Diego

How an Amazon Alexa skill can open the door to data-driven medical insights.

We created an Amazon Alexa skill named "Ouch, That Hurts!" which allows patients to easily report symptoms without needing to keep a journal or call the doctor. By making it extremely easy to report such symptoms, we could collect a plethora of data that could be used to help predict and diagnose symptoms in the future.

## Indeed Job Search City Recommender
### ASA DataFest @ Chapman Univ.

We were given an anonymized dataset from indeed.com, and tasked to come up with an interesting question and create a short business pitch to present to indeed by the end of the hackathon. After plenty of stress and sleep deprivation, we posed a question to find out what cities have the best prospects for different types of jobs and we created an algorithm to rank and recommend cities that are well suited for a given job industry.



# Research

## [AR-NOC](/ar-noc.html)
### Qualcomm Institute, National Science Foundation

My team is building a hybrid Helpdesk and DevOps chatbot to aid researchers on the Nautilus HyperCluster. We are currently exploring various clustering techniques for natural language queries.

This massive Kubernetes cluster which supports the Pacific Research Platform allows researchers to share data and compute resources. They don't all know how to use Kubernetes or Docker, and it's important to maintain cluster health if something accidentally breaks—so that's where Kubot comes in to the picture.

Another of our main NSF grants is to create an augmented reality network operations center (AR-NOC) to monitor cluster health and diagnose problems that may arise. I am helping prototype data input pipelines and automate existing diagnosis pipelines.

## Research Assistant, Bootgraph
### UC San Diego

Working closely with one of my favorite professors, Prof. Aaron Fraenkel, we explored bias in various network graph sampling schemes.

We developed statistical approaches to describe the bias in a degree distribution from a sampling scheme. We researched new sampling schemes to address this bias, and we implemented the Snowboot R package in Python.

## HDSI Undergraduate Fellowship
### Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute

As a team of four undergraduates, we were rewarded with a competitive fellowship to conduct a self-lead data science research project. In effort to reduce the negative health effects of food deserts, we developed an accessible tool which generates grocery lists optimized on both nutrition and cost.

We got our hands dirty with various forms of data mining, and turned to pure numerical optimization as our core algorithm. We looked at Linear Programming, Continuous Quadratic Programming, and Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming in order to accomplish our goals.

We will be presenting our results in November 2019.

## Sapie Space
### Startup @ The Basement Incubator

I worked as a machine learning engineer at a startup founded on campus. We built a product to match clients with microinfluencers to boost ROI.

Microinfluencers are often location and demographic specific, they fill a particular niche, and they often don't realize that they are an influencer! From a database of all Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter personalities, our service would rank their influence over a given industry and keywords using recommender systems, association rule learning, and other graph theory techniques.

# Communication

## [Invited Speaker, "What Ignited My Love For Data Science"](https://youtu.be/S7srcEu3Lpw)
### Ignite Talks UC San Diego

Ignite Talks are speedy (5-minute) TED-esque presentations.

I outline the purpose of data science and reveal what ignited my interest in observing, analyzing, and communicating data.

## Datathon Mentor <small>(Now called DataHacks)</small>
### Data Science Student Society (DS3) @ UC San Diego

I had the distinct opportunity to be one of the few mentors at UC San Diego's first-ever data-centric hackathon.

I mentored over 100+ students who were tackling projects on Azure's computer vision classification models, Google Local business reviews, and Open Data traffic collisions in San Diego.

## Instructional Assistant
### UC San Diego

I've tutored for various DSC courses, such as DSC 10, 40B, and 80. I was even placed in charge of discussion sections (both creating [the materials](https://github.com/ucsd-ets/dsc10-fa18/tree/master/Discussions) and leading the sessions). [Week 9](https://github.com/ucsd-ets/dsc10-fa18/blob/master/Discussions/week09/discussion09-filled.ipynb) has some good stuff... then again I think I liked all of the notebooks I made!

Teaching holds a very special place in my heart, and I have no doubt that I will continue to pursue opportunities to spread knowledge and facilitate those "a-ha" moments!

# Involvement / Relevant Courses {#(Extra)curriculars}

## Student Representative, Course Evaluation Support
### Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute

Since I joined the program, I have been advocating for a student representative position to help feedback reach the right ears.  Having seen the major through the eyes of a student as as a tutor, and being able to empathize with both students after me and professors above me, I think I have a unique perspective that will allow me to come up with beneficial changes to the current curriculum.

I want to help make this program the best data science program in the world, and I'm so extraordinarily happy that this opportunity finally exists!

## Committee Member
### Data Science Student Society (DS3)

I am part of the committee organizing an upcoming conference to address the purpose and power of data science, and what UC San Diego's department is doing to advance the field.  We will be showcasing faculty and student research, projects from industry connections, and we will be inviting two keynote speakers to present broadly on the essence of data science.

I am heavily involved with the management of this committee, and am currently in the process of organizing our timeline for contacting presenters.

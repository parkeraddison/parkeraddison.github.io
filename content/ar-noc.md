# The Nautilus HyperCluster...
## Our platform brings researchers together, and the future to life

I'm embarking on my first experience with government funded research! Our team works directly with the Nautilus Hypercluster—the digital backbone of the Pacific Research Platform, to aid the realization of three interrelated NSF awards (CHASE-CI, PRP, and TNRP). Here at UC San Diego, Nautilus' homebase, we are working under brilliant minds that have contributed to the NSFNET, NSF-funded supercomputer centers, SIGGRAPH, and the PRP itself!

I am creating a chatbot to resolve internal struggles between researchers and tricky technologies required to work with the cluster. By training directly on documentation and on a vast corpus of chatlogs, we will respond to natural language queries, and by automating diagnosis pipelines we will conduct root cause analysis for error messages.

We are also building an AR Network Operations Center. For that, I will brainstorm visualization techniques and assist with data pipelines. This AR-NOC is of huge interest to the NSF as it will allow PRP admins to better identify and diagnose issues in the network—something that will be vital as we move towards a National Research Platform.

We are excited to bring the future to life with this project, and I hope to share more along the way! 

Our "VRoom" contains an entire wall full of screens—thirty-two 4k monitors, each with their own computer, can display huge data visualizations and immersive renders.

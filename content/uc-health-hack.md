## How an Amazon Alexa skill can open the door to data-driven medical insights

The weekend before SD Hacks, I participated in the 2018 UC Health Hack. I worked alongside a fellow classmate, as well as a pediatrician from Harvard, a database engineer, and a software solutions architect. Working with this team was a great example of the true power of team diversity.

Consulting with the pediatrician, we discovered that patients not reporting their symptoms is a huge problem in the medical field. While a patient may complain to their doctor about a pain in their heart or about a cough that wont subside, other more ‘minor’ symptoms such as a headache or soreness end up going largely unreported.

We created an Amazon Alexa skill named "Ouch, That Hurts!" which allows patients to easily report symptoms without needing to keep a journal or call the doctor. By making it extremely easy to report such symptoms, we could collect a plethora of data that could be used to help predict and diagnose symptoms in the future.

I got my hands dirty with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB in order to establish persistence with a scalable database.

        <p>What drives my interest in data science is the ability for seemingly disparate numbers to weave a compelling story — a story that requires both quantitative analysis and qualitative reflection in order to be told.<br><br>I was born in July, 1999
          in San Francisco. Throughout my childhood, I was interested in understanding the world around me. I developed an aptitude for mathetmatics and natural sciences. However, at the same time, the way we understand the world is just as much about
          how the world works as it is about how we experience it. I've used music to connect to humanity, and have taken interest in philosphy, how it pertains to the way the world effects us, and how in turn it illuminates the effects our actions have
          on the world.<br><br>We live at an incredible point in time, there is so much discovery right at our fingertips, but with those discoveries there are also many questions to be asked. I hope to be able to interpret those questions and look to
          the world for answers.

        <p>After two quarters at UC San Diego I was offered an IA (instructional assistant) position for an introductory data science class, <i>DSC 10: Principles of Data Science</i>! I am excited to be part of a brand new major, and to be among the people who can open students' eyes to the world of data science.<br><br>This quarter, the CSE Department didn't want the Data Science program taking all of the graduate student TA's, so I had to assume many of the roles of a TA such as creating, revising, and grading homework and project assignments, grading exams and creating exam solutions, and proctoring exams — in addition to my primary job holding office hours to tutor students.  I wrote more about my experience <a href=#>here</a>.</p>

          What drives my interest in data science is the ability for seemingly disparate numbers to weave a compelling story — a story
          that requires both quantitative analysis and qualitative reflection in order to be told.</p>
        <p>
          I was born in July, 1999 in San Francisco. I have always been fascinated with understanding the world around me and early
          on I developed an aptitude for mathetmatics and natural sciences. In recent years I've realized that the way we
          understand the world is just as much about how the world works as it is about how we experience it.</p>
        <p>
          I have taken an interest in data science to achieve a greater understanding of our world. I have taken an interest in communication
          in order to spread that understanding. And I have taken an interest in philosphy, how it pertains to the way the
          world affects us, and how in turn it illuminates the effects our actions have on the world.</p>
        <p>
          We live at an incredible point in time, there is so much discovery right at our fingertips, but with those discoveries there
          are also many questions to be asked. I hope to be able to interpret those questions and look to the world for answers.</p>

          <p>
            After two quarters at UC San Diego I was offered an IA (instructional assistant) position for the third-ever offering of
            a new data science class,
            <i>DSC 10: Principles of Data Science</i>. I am excited to be part of a brand new major, and to be among the people
            who can open new students' eyes to the world of data science.</p>
          <p>
            This quarter, the CSE Department didn't want the Data Science program taking all of the graduate student TA's, so I had to
            assume many of the roles of a TA such as: creating, revising, and grading homework and project assignments; grading
            exams, creating exam solutions, and proctoring exams; and participating heavily in course organization and management.
            I did this all in addition to holding office hours to tutor students. I wrote about some more exciting experiences

        <div class="content scroll-reveal">
          <p>
            With a team of four other students in my major, we represented UC San Diego at the ASA (American Statistical Association)
            DataFest held at Chapman University. We had a midterm right before the event started — and the drive took a few
            hours — so after getting a late start we were in an exceptionally crunchy time crunch to fulfill what we were
            tasked with upon arrival.</p>
          <p>
            We were given an anonymized dataset from
            <i>indeed.com</i>, and tasked to come up with an interesting question and create a short business pitch to present
            to
            <i>indeed</i> by the end of the hackathon. After plenty of stress and sleep depravation, we posed a question to
            find out what cities have the best prospects for different types of jobs and we created an algorithm to rank
            and recommend cities that are well suited for a given job industry.</p>

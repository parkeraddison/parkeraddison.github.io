          What drives my interest in data science is the ability for seemingly disparate numbers to weave a compelling
          story—a story that requires both quantitative analysis and qualitative reflection in order to be told.</p>
        <p>
          I was born in July, 1999 in San Francisco. I have always been fascinated with understanding the world around
          me and early on I developed an aptitude for mathetmatics and natural sciences. In recent years I've realized
          that the way we understand the world is just as much about how the world works as it is about how we
          experience it.</p>
        <p>
          I have taken an interest in data science to achieve a greater understanding of our world. I have taken an
          interest in communication in order to spread that understanding. And I have taken an interest in philosphy,
          how it pertains to the way the world affects us, and how in turn it illuminates the effects our actions have
          on the world.</p>
        <p>
          We live at an incredible point in time, there is so much discovery right at our fingertips, but with those
          discoveries there are also many questions to be asked. I hope to be able to interpret those questions and
          look to the world for answers.</p>

              I teamed up with two fellow undergrads to create a 3D graphic visualizer/editor for neural nets. We
              created a web application that turned a Keras model json into an interactive model that could be modified
              and exported as a json again.
          </p>
          <p>
              We are currently planning a massive overhaul so that we can turn this project into a fully-functioning
              and useful public tool to help encourage deeper understand of neural nets and reduce the copy-and-paste epidemic.

              The weekend before SD Hacks, I participated in the UC Health Hack 2018.  I worked alongside a fellow
              classmate, as well as a pediatrician from Harvard, a database engineer, and a software architect.
              Working with this team was the first time I've seen the true power of team diversity first-hand.

          <p>
              We created an Amazon Alexa skill named "Ouch, That Hurts!" which allows patients to easily report
              symptoms without needing to keep a journal or call the doctor. By making it extremely easy to report
              such symptoms, we could collect a plethora of data that could be used to help predict and diagnose symptoms
              in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
              I got my hands dirty with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB in order to establish persistence with a scalable
              database.

          <p>For my second quarter tutoring DSC 10, I have been tasked with creating and leading discussion sections.

          <p>
            This is an intense but extremely rewarding role—while the main purpose of a discussion section is to make
            sure that nobody falls behind, I make sure that everyone leaves my section understanding the material covered
            in lecture <i>and better equipped to handle data science problems outside of the classroom.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            I do this by presenting real datasets and asking real questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The thing I'm most happy about is the level of engagement expressed by the students who attend discussions—it's
            truly heartwarming to see them interested in applying what we're learning.

            &#09;After two quarters at UC San Diego I was offered an IA (instructional assistant) position for the
            third-ever offering of a new data science class, <i>DSC 10: Principles of Data Science</i>. I am excited to
            be part of a brand new major, and to be among the people who can open new students' eyes to the world of
            data science.</p>
          <p>
            This quarter, the CSE Department didn't want the Data Science program taking all of the graduate student
            TA's, so I had to assume many of the roles of a TA such as: creating, revising, and grading homework and
            project assignments; grading exams, creating exam solutions, and proctoring exams; and participating
            heavily in course organization and management. I did this all in addition to holding office hours to tutor
            students.

            With a team of four other students in my major, we represented UC San Diego at the ASA (American
            Statistical Association) DataFest held at Chapman University. We had a midterm right before the event
            started—and the drive took a few hours—so after getting a late start we were in an exceptionally
            crunchy time crunch to fulfill what we were tasked with upon arrival.</p>
          <p>
            We were given an anonymized dataset from <i>indeed.com</i>, and tasked to come up with an interesting
            question and create a short business pitch to present to <i>indeed</i> by the end of the hackathon. After
            plenty of stress and sleep depravation, we posed a question to find out what cities have the best prospects
            for different types of jobs and we created an algorithm to rank and recommend cities that are well suited
            for a given job industry.</p>

                    <p>
                        The weekend before SD Hacks, I participated in the 2018 <a
                            href="https://healthhack.uchealth.edu/">UC Health Hack</a>. I worked alongside a fellow
                        classmate, as well as a pediatrician from Harvard, a database engineer, and a software solutions
                        architect. Working with this team was a great example of the true power of team diversity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consulting with the pediatrician, we discovered that patients not reporting their symptoms is a
                        <i>huge</i> problem in the medical field. While a patient may complain to their doctor about a
                        pain in their heart or about a cough that wont subside, other more &lsquo;minor&rsquo; symptoms
                        such as a headache or soreness end up going largely unreported.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We created an Amazon Alexa skill named "Ouch, That Hurts!" which allows patients to easily
                        report symptoms without needing to keep a journal or call the doctor. By making it extremely
                        easy to report such symptoms, we could collect a plethora of data that could be used to help
                        predict and diagnose symptoms in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I got my hands dirty with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB in order to establish persistence with a
                        scalable database.
                    </p>
